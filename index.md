# GitHub Pages Tutorial

## Abstract (Introduction)

Hello, world! Today we are going to talk about GitHub Pages! I'm sure most of you watching are already familiar with GitHub. The service we are going talk about is a web hosting service offered by GitHub which allows users to host static web pages or websites through GitHub. These sites can then be accessed as subdomains of the github.io domain, or from a custom domain that the user has purchased.

## Body
The easiest way to explain what GitHub pages *is* would be to say that it's an extension or plug-in for GitHub. If you already know how to use GitHub, learning to create your own website via GitHub Pages will be a breeze! It's not much different from creating a normal GitHub repository from the website (or a "repo"), as you will see in this tutorial.

[Click "Create new repository" button]
To get started with creating your website, you simply create a new repository, as you would normally create a repository on GitHub. You then give it a name you would like to use for your website.

[Start creating the site by scrolling to the theme chooser under settings]
You're doing great so far! Next you want to start building your actual web page or website. To do this, open the setting tab. Now scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section and click the **Choose a theme** button to begin building your website. You'll then be directed to the theme chooser where you can choose from a selection of themes for your website. Don't worry, this can be changed later on if you decide you don't like the theme you picked. To simply get started, you can choose any theme for now.

[Edit your site]
Now is where you can start adding your own content. Click on the **Code** tab to make desired changes, and once you're finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Commit changes**.

That's it! After about 10 minutes, your site will be online for visitors to view at username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. Congratulations, you made your first website with GitHub pages!

[Making changes]
However, you may want to make some changes to your website.

[Open config file and edit source code]
A quick and easy change will be to remove the default title of your index page and add a custom, possibly friendlier and more welcoming title. Since this is a quick change, this can be done on the default branch: master. View and open the _config.yml file under the **Code** tab, and click the pencil icon. Since your site currently has no title, you can add the line:

> title: (Custom welcome message)

You can then add a description by adding a second line:

> description: (Tell the visitor about your site!)

Click **commit changes** to make your second commit and update your site. And you're done!

## Conclusion
Thank you for watching our video! I hope you found it informative and that you now understand the basics on how to create your very own webpage using GitHub pages!
